        To minimize this effect, the algorithm first floors the expected numbers per process ID.
        Then it distributes the remaining events according to the relative contribution of each process ID to the batch, which is calculated by the normalization weights.
        The result is again floored for process IDs with a relative contribution below the median and ceiled for process IDs with a relative contribution above the median, to minimize the difference to the desired batch size.
